        <h2>What is Lojban?</h2>
        <p>
            Lojban is an artifical spoken and written language that has been in development for over fifty years.  Although the finer points are still being worked on, it has been suitable for everyday communication for many years.  It has a number of features that make it stand out from other languages, both natural and artificial.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It is regular;</strong> there are few exceptions to the rules and it is spelled phonetically.</li>
            <li><strong>It is based upon mathematic logic;</strong> it is unambiguous and easily processed by computers.</li>
            <li><strong>It is culturally neutral;</strong> its root words are distilled from the six most widely spoken languages in the world.</li>
            <li><strong>It is designed to enhance clarity of thought and communication.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This unique combination of features makes it useful for a variety of purposes, both creative and technical.  Some people use it to investigate scientific theories, some people write poetry with it, and some people simply indulge their inner geek with it.
