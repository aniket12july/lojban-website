There's a few quick guidelines for contributing that I find help things run smoothly.

Meaningful commit messages are nice to have, but not vital.  If you find yourself unable to say anything specific, it can be a sign you're lumping too many unrelated changes together.  Consider committing more often, when you complete specific tasks.

Any changes that aren't just drop-in-and go, e.g. database schema changes, should be noted in docs/news.txt along with a timestamp.  Same goes for anything you want to call particular attention to.  Newest items go first.

If you put in a temporary workaround that you intend to fix later, put FIXME in a comment by it and consider creating a ticket for it.

Please try to check in only valid HTML and CSS, but don't tie yourself in a knot trying to get it that way - it's better to check in invalid code that does something than to put it off until you can figure out how to do it in a valid way.

Discussion should happen on the website development mailing list available here:
