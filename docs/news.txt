2008-05-06:

* A new model has been added for the "First Time Stories". The submit form works now, too, even though you have to turn off javascript. You can look at the stories in the django admin. Don't forget to run syncdb.

--------------------

2008-04-17:

* A customised action has been added that downloads data from jbovlaste and generates a fixture containing all the valsi.  You shouldn't have to run it yourself as a copy of the fixture has been checked in.  You will still have to use loaddata to get it into the database though.

    python lojban/manage.py generate-valsi-fixture
    python lojban/manage.py loaddata valsi

    Note that Django bug #5825 prevents customised actions from working.  In order for generate-valsi-fixture to work, you need to edit django/core/management/__init__.py and comment out sys.path.pop() in setup_environ().  See http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5825 for more details.

2008-04-17:

* New models for various other types of valsi have been added.

    python lojban/manage.py syncdb

2008-04-17:

* The `place_structure` CharField for the Gismu model has changed to the `definition` TextField.

    python lojban/manage.py dbshell
        alter table main_gismu alter column place_structure type text;
        alter table main_gismu rename column place_structure to definition;

* A `notes` TextField and an `official` BooleanField have been added to the Gismu model.

    python lojban/manage.py dbshell
        alter table main_gismu add column notes text;
        alter table main_gismu add column official boolean;
        update main_gismu set official = true;
        alter table main_gismu alter column official set not null;
