* Google Search now supplies content searching within the site.  At the moment, Google has only got stale content indexed, so we should produce a sitemap in the near future.

This funtionality requires httplib2, available at http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/

--------------------

2008-05-20:

* A new model and a customised action have been added for IRC integration.  The customised action starts an IRC bot that sits in #lojban silently keeping track of how many people are in the channel and how long it has been since anybody said anything.

You do not need to run this bot unless you are making changes to it.  If this is the case, please change the configuration to use a different channel and nick beforehand to avoid annoying people in #lojban during development.

    python lojban/manage.py syncdb
    mkdir run

    python lojban/manage.py irc-bot start # Starts the bot.
    python lojban/manage.py irc-bot stop # Stops the bot.

Please note that it requires a ./run/ directory within the website directory it can write to for the purpose of process management.

This functionality requires irclib, available at http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net

* New models have been added for weblog aggregation.  At the moment, the assumption is that only one weblog will be present in the database; the Lojban LiveJournal community.  This has been added to the initial_data fixture, so syncing the database will add the tables and necessary data.

    python lojban/manage.py syncdb

In addition, a customised action has been added to fetch the entries in all registered weblogs.  This is designed to run as a cron job, but you'll probably want to execute it by hand for development purposes.

    python lojban/manage.py fetch-feeds

This functionality requires the Universal Feed Parser, available at http://www.feedparser.org

--------------------

2008-05-06:

* A new model has been added for the "First Time Stories". The submit form works now, too, even though you have to turn off javascript. You can look at the stories in the django admin. Don't forget to run syncdb.

--------------------

2008-04-17:

* A customised action has been added that downloads data from jbovlaste and generates a fixture containing all the valsi.  You shouldn't have to run it yourself as a copy of the fixture has been checked in.  You will still have to use loaddata to get it into the database though.

    python lojban/manage.py generate-valsi-fixture
    python lojban/manage.py loaddata valsi

    Note that Django bug #5825 prevents customised actions from working.  In order for generate-valsi-fixture to work, you need to edit django/core/management/__init__.py and comment out sys.path.pop() in setup_environ().  See http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5825 for more details.

--------------------

2008-04-17:

* New models for various other types of valsi have been added.

    python lojban/manage.py syncdb

--------------------

2008-04-17:

* The `place_structure` CharField for the Gismu model has changed to the `definition` TextField.

    python lojban/manage.py dbshell
        alter table main_gismu alter column place_structure type text;
        alter table main_gismu rename column place_structure to definition;

* A `notes` TextField and an `official` BooleanField have been added to the Gismu model.

    python lojban/manage.py dbshell
        alter table main_gismu add column notes text;
        alter table main_gismu add column official boolean;
        update main_gismu set official = true;
        alter table main_gismu alter column official set not null;

--------------------

2008-04-17:

* All news items from the current website have been imported into the initial_data fixture.

    python lojban/manage.py syncdb
